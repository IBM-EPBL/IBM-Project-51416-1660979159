IDEATION PHASE:
	One of the most important jobs of a designer is to come up with new and innovative solutions to user problems. How can designers keep generating innovative ideas? The answer is in design thinking ideation process. It allows designers to come up with fresh ideas by thinking outside the box, challenging assumptions, and exploring new territories. Thus, the ideation phase is important and gives clarity to create the right environment. The ideation phase of design thinking is guided by the user problems that were defined during the empathize phase. Ideation is about the exploration and identification of potential solutions. Not all ideas will be viable solutions and that’s okay. The primary goal of ideation is to spark creativity and innovation.
  
PREREQUISITES:
	The following features are required to accomplish the task.
1.	One must create an IBM account.
2.	Login to the account after creation.

Prior knowledge of the following concepts:
Chatbot:
	At the most basic level, a chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversation (either written or spoken), allowing humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communication with a real person.
  
Watson assistant intents, entities and dialogs: 
	An intent is to perform an action on the screen. Within a chatbot intent refers to the goal the customer has in mind when typing in a question or comment.
	An entity represents a term or object that is relevant to your intents and that provides a specific context for an intent.
  
PROJECT DESIGNING PHASE-I
•	PROPOSED SOLUTION
•	PROBLEM SOLUTION FIT
•	SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE
	Project design is an early phase of the project lifecycle where ideas, processes, resources, and deliverables are planned out. A project design comes before a project plan as it's a broad overview whereas a project plan includes more detailed information. The aim is to develop one or more designs that can be used to achieve the desired project goals. The project design steps might generate various outputs, such as sketches, flowcharts, site trees, HTML screen designs, prototypes, photo impressions, and more. In this phase, the requirements that are associated with a project result are specified as clearly as possible. This involves identifying the expectations that all of the involved parties have with regard to the project result. 
  
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PHASE-II
•	CUSTOMER JOURNEY MAPS
•	FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
•	DATA FLOW DIAGRAMS
•	TECHNOLOGY ARCHITECTURE
From this milestone you will  continue working on the project design phase. Customer journey maps are created to understand the user interactions & experiences with the application. Also the functional requirements diagram, data flow diagram, and technology architecture diagram are created in the project development phase-II.

PROJECT PLANNING
	Project planning is at the heart of the project life cycle, and tells everyone involved where you’re going and how you’re going to get there. The planning phase is when the project plans are documented, the project deliverables and requirements are defined, and the project schedule is created. It involves creating a set of plans to help guide your team through the implementation and closure phases of the project. The plans created during this phase will help you manage time, cost, quality, changes, risk, and related issues. The planning phase refines the project’s objectives, which were gathered during the initiation phase. It includes planning the steps necessary to meet those objectives by further identifying the specific activities and resources required to com¬plete the project. The Planning Phase focuses principally on required project planning work. Proper comprehensive project planning is essential to a successful IT project, and incomplete project planning and analysis are frequently root causes of project failure.
