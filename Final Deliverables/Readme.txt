PROJECT REPORT
PYTHON FLASK:
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. 
It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. 
It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.
 
Flask usage in our code : (app.py)
Flask is used for developing web applications using python, implemented on Werkzeug and Jinja2. Advantages of using Flask framework are: There is a built-in development server and a fast debugger provided.
It is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.

Thus, the use of the flask in our project is to provide the necessary tools and features to build an application.

HTML
HTML—“HyperText Markup Language”—is the language used to tell your web browser what each part of a website is. So, using HTML, you can define headers, paragraphs, links, images, and more, so your browser knows how to structure the web page you're looking at.

Use of HTML in our code: (Chatbot.html)
We used the HTML code to define the content which includes headings, paragraphs, images etc.
We have integrated the Watson assistant and javascript into the HTML code and also have given suitable headings, paragraphs and contents using HTML.


Source files for main HTML code implementation are contained in static :
CSS
js
img
vendor 

Uses of CSS, Js :

CSS - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, colour, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

Thus, we used CSS file to style our web application by adding fonts , colours, size etc.

Js - JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.  

Thus, we have used javascript in our code to make the user interaction better by implementing interactive elements available in JavaScript.

Files we used for our code implementation :

img - Contains the image that needs to be displayed during the execution of code.

Vendor - Contains files like javascript and CSS to style the small elements present in the web application. The program to create small icons, highlight boxes etc is done in this part of the code and merged into the HTML code by using the src tag in the main code.
